- Today's programming wisdom is to always prioritize your time and focus on the most important tasks. This means breaking down your project into smaller, manageable tasks and prioritizing them based on their impact on your overall goal. By doing this, you can ensure that you are making progress towards your goal and not getting lost in trivial tasks that don't contribute to the end result.

Another important aspect of programming is understanding the basics of the language or framework you're using. Before diving into a project, make sure you have a firm grasp of its fundamentals, as this will save you time in the long run. If you run into problems, don’t be afraid to ask for help or search for resources online. There is a vast amount of information available for programmers, and leveraging this knowledge can make you a better and more efficient developer.
